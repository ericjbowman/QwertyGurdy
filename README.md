#SampleJam

SampleJam is a web application that allows the user to choose from
several producers (Oliver, Pascaal, Point Point, and Tennyson), play
one of their loops, and play their samples with a computer keyboard.

SampleJam uses WAD, a web audio DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to loop
samples and allow users to manipulate volume and speed of those samples as
they play.

# Qwerty-Gurdy

Qwerty-Gurdy is a web application that allows the user to choose from
several producers (Oliver, Pascaal, Torres/Rengifo, and Tennyson), play
3 of their loops, and play their samples with a computer keyboard. Users can
manipulate the volume/speed of loops, and manipulate the volume, pitch,
reverb, and filter of samples. Users can upload loops from their device
and have access to all other user's loops.

Qwerty-Gurdy uses WAD, a web audio DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) to loop
samples, and allow sound manipulation.
